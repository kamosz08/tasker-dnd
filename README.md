# Tasker DnD app

I wanted to create an app with real time updates, trello clone was the first thing that came to my mind. I have never planned to share this app with the world, it lacks a lot of features and wouldn't be competitive. I am actually using it when im working on other projects :)

# Most important tech details

- Backend:
	- I didn't implement BE here, all of the server side (real time DB, auth) is handled by firebase
- Frontend: 
	- React
	- Material UI with styled components and a bit of css modules
	- Redux combined with hooks that subscribe to firebase
